# web_automation_no_api
This project was created to interact with a website since the data needed from this site was not available through an API.
It interacts with and downloads zip files from the website, extracts and renames the zip file content, uploads them to Azure blob storage and sends alert messages to a Microsoft Teams Channel via a webhook.
